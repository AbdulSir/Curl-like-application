# Curl-like-application

## Project Description:

<p>This project mimics the functionality of Curl providing a library and command-line tool for transferring data using various network protocols. This project leverages TCP protocol for implementation to guarantee packet transmission over unreliable network links. It is also possible to use UDP protocol that does not guarantee the transfer, but the reliability is insured by implementing a specific instance of the Automatic-Repeat-Request (ARQ) protocol called: Selective Repeat ARQ / Selective Reject ARQ. </p>

## Technologies Used:

<ul>
  <li>Java </li>
  <li>Sockets </li>
  <li>Routers </li>
  <li>Selective Repeat ARQ </li>
</ul
